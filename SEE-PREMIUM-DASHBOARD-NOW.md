## 🧪 Test Toast Notifications

**After you see the dashboard, test this:**

```powershell
.\add-lead-now.ps1
```

**Wait 5 seconds → Beautiful notification appears in top-right!** 🔔

---

## ❓ What I Did

**I upgraded your code, then I ran:**
```powershell
docker-compose up -d --build client
```

**This command:**
1. ✅ Installed new packages (framer-motion, react-hot-toast)
2. ✅ Compiled your React app with new features
3. ✅ Built new Docker image
4. ✅ Started new container

**Time taken:** 1-2 minutes
**Result:** Premium dashboard is now live!

## 📚 For Future Reference

**Whenever I make changes to your code, you need to run:**
```powershell
cd D:\ai-intelligence-hub
docker-compose up -d --build client
```

**Why?**
- Your app runs in Docker containers
- Changes on your computer ≠ Changes in container
- Must rebuild to see updates
